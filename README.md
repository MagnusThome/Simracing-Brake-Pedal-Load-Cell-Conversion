# Simracing-Brake-Pedal-Load-Cell-Conversion

Mount a strain gauge in your simracing brake pedal. This kit will output an analog voltage that represents the force applied on the brake pedal. This voltage can be used instead of the voltage from the potentiometer used originally.
  
Parts needed:
- Strain Gauge with included HX711 board  
- Arduino Nano 5 Volt  
- Resistor 4.7 kOhm  
- Capacitor 100nF  
  
You'll have to be a bit creative to mount the strain gauge in the pedal so the pedal pushes against it for it to detect the forces applied. It's not that sensitive how much force and at what angle the force is applied, here's an example on how I mounted it in a Logitech G25 pedal set:
